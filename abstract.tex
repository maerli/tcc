	        In the beginning of modern human history, we are concerned how to evaluate the human tasks, and his corresponding abilities too. But, this kind of evaluation its depends on subject. Since the middle 20Th century, mathematicians and psicometrists created methodologies enabled to measure latent traits, such ability and proficiency in a specific area of knowledge. Since the CTT(Classical Test Theory) has been created a great evolution on the measurement theory. But CTT had some limitations, so IRT(Item Response Theory) comes to supply some of these limitations, this way was created a theory that measure with accuracy latent traits. It is IRT characterized by the item estimation  where testing we seek for three basic parameters: difficult, discrimination and casual percentage of correct answer. Due the adoption by Enem(An exam to measure ability of Brazilian high school students) from IRT, its has
	       been guarantee more visibility to the IRT in Brazil. But the math complexity has been discouraged teachers to apply IRT in his evaluations.
